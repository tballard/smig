First things first.  A smig is a kind of beard.  Sorta the goatee motif.
Makes you look mighty sporty, similar to what this will do to your UI.

This is a wrapper for the MigLayout java layout manager for use from Scala.
Not bullet-proofed and my first Scala project, but still not totally without
merit, I think.  One objective was to strongly type the heck out of
it.  If you like doing all your specifications using strings, oh, well.  
Another was to make it somewhat easier to debug.  I also rethought the
way cells are specified and moved some parts of the API to where I like
them better.  The callbacks are now added per component and separately,
instead of as an all inclusive callback class.  I'm not too excited to use
the java version, now, since this is so much better.  ;-)

The demo unveils the basic usage.

This file is in the root directory of a netbeans project.  The jars directory
needs to  have miglayout-4.0-swing.jar and miglayout-4.0-swing.jar or some such
in it.  Or use it in some IDE that handles it better.  I was just using
netbeans in general and went with the flow.
