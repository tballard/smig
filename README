This is a wrapper for the MigLayout java layout manager for use from Scala.
Pretty much alpha and my first Scala project, but still not totally without
merit, I think.  One objective was to strongly type the heck out of
it.  Another was to make it somewhat easier to debug.  I also rethought the
way cells are specified and moved some parts of the API to where I like
them better.  I'm not too excited to use the java version, now, since this 
is so much better. ;-)

The demo is worth your time.

This file is in the root directory of a netbeans project.  The jars directory
needs to  have miglayout-4.0-swing.jar and miglayout-4.0-swing.jar or some such
in it.  Or use it in some IDE that handles it better.  I was just using
netbeans in general and went with the flow.
